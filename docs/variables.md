# Variables

## Naming
### Name constants using ALL_CAPS
```lua
local MY_CONSTANT = "constant value"
MY_GLOBAL_CONSTANT = "another constant value"
```

### camelCase non-constant local variable names
```lua
local myVariable = "variable value"
```

### PascalCase non-constant global variable names
```lua
MyGlobalVariable = "global variable value"
```

### Use underscore "_" as the name of a variable that cannot be deleted but is unused.
```lua
local function printValues(map)
    for _, v in pairs(map) do
        print(v)
    end
end
```

### Enums Vs Booleans
Enums (table<any, integer>) should be used to reflect the state of something when more than two options exist. A common anti-pattern is using multiple booleans to reflect the state. This is confusing and problematic, because the code then needs to defend against impossible states, isWalking and isRunning both being true at the same time. It also makes the code more opaque and harder to reason about. What does it mean if isWalking and isRunning are both false? That we don't know, or that the state is idle? Or maybe swimming?

```lua title="BAD"
local isWalking = false
local isRunning = false
```
```lua title="GOOD"
local MOVEMENT = {
    UNKNOWN = 1,
    WALKING = 2,
    RUNNING = 3
}
local movementState = MOVEMENT.UNKNOWN
```
Representing the state is an enum this way also makes it easier to modify in the future to add more states. Such as idle, swimming, flying, falling, etc. Adding an UNKNOWN field is useful when the enum isn't exhaustive, as a catch all to represent any other state.

## Location
Local variables within a function should be declared as close as possible to the place where they are used. This limits what the developer must keep in their head while reading the code.
Local variables declared outside of a function should be declared at the top of the file, grouped together.
Global variables should be declared at the top of the file grouped together. client/server global variables should only be declared within a single client/server file. This helps keep things organized instead of spreading random globals around the resource.
